# Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard

## Overview

This **Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard** has been designed to provide insights into six key diversity metrics within an organization. Using **Power BI**, I have visualized important aspects of the organization's workforce, helping track diversity and inclusion efforts across different demographics and business areas.

## Key Features

The dashboard presents data across the following six parameters:

1. **Hiring**: Visual representation of diversity in new hires.
2. **Promotion**: Analysis of how promotions are distributed across different demographics.
3. **Turnover Rate**: Insights into employee turnover rates based on diversity factors.
4. **Performance Rating**: Distribution of performance ratings by gender, age group, etc.
5. **Executive Gender Balance**: Gender representation within the executive team.
6. **Age Group**: Workforce age group analysis to assess age diversity.

## Dashboard Functionality

### Interactive Filters

To enhance user experience and data exploration, slicers are provided to allow users to filter the data dynamically based on:

- **Gender**
- **Age Group**

### Visualizations

Each parameter is visualized using charts/graphs that are designed for clarity and actionable insights. The visuals include:

- **Bar charts**
- **Pie charts**
- **Line graphs**
- **Heatmaps**

These visuals help in quickly understanding the current status and trends in diversity and inclusion efforts within the organization.

## How to Use
